                <p> Hi Guys, My name is Rashawn Conner and I'm a current IT intern from Year Up. I've been in the I.T. industry for the last 2 years and it has been an interesting journey filled with unique surprises on different aspects of this business. The first piece of advice I'll give anyone is be ready to become a life long learner.This is a mindset that will help anyone succeed in our industry  today.  Things will change and sometimes they will change quickly or often. Just make sure you brush up on your tech every now and again at the least because this will prevent those changes from being a complete surprise to you.</p>

                <p> "How do I do this Shawn?"" Well the answer is simple really: reading and watching. Read up on the newer technology becoming available along with understanding its practical use in the business world. This will help you stay in the loop. One day I  will become apart tech chat to remind me of this habit.</p>

                <p> Most of my tech background comes from two  Institutions, the first being CSI or Computer Systems Institute and Year Up Chicago. The first program called CSI was a place where I got my first peak into what the I.T. industry looked like. There I was taught a few basic principles about how we do things in a company setting along with good habits (some I explained above ) a tech should consider. It was a fun learning some of small things we do to create an effective work environment and maintain the machines that move company's into the future. I've some mistakes broken some things too, but all things considered I stand to become a great technician one day. Year Up was a place where I got exposed to the other side of the coin.</p>

                <p> This is the business/professional side of Corporate America and some norms that come along with being in those types of environments while still performing at a high level. It not easy, but it is certainly doable with effort and practice. Year Up Chicago manage to reeducate me on some of those small, yet important things we do can do to get the most from the professional experience and  our careers.</p>

                <p> Me personally I'm a big sports fan when it comes to the NBA. Basketball was something that taught me a few things about life so I hold it close to my heart. Some of my hobbies include, running, working out, virtual tech, building PC's, Gaming , and E-commerce Business. I do enjoy the art of story telling whether it's good TV/movie/video. Sometimes I do embrace the inner kid in me as well with anime/Sport entertainment. Thank for reading up on me.</p>
